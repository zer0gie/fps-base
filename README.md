## FPS Base

FPS Base - a simple FPS game example using UniTask, Animancer, DoTween and Zenject. This example provides fundamental mechanics for creating an FPS game, including character control, shooting, physics, and interactive objects.

**NOTE:** This project made as a test, has no best practices and must be used only as an example, not as a guide.

**To create a new weapon:** add the `Weapon` script to the prepared model and configure scriptable `WeaponConfig`.
   
**Run the `SampleScene`** to test game mechanics.

## ðŸš€ Features
- First-person character control
- Shooting, reloading, and weapon switching
- Character movement and physics
- Interactive demo scene with various targets
- Unity New Input System based keyboard and gamepad input support ðŸŽ®
- Finite State Machine pattern for weapon logic

## ðŸ“š Libraries
- **UniTask** - for asynchronous operations, including FSM pattern implementation for weapon mechanics
- **Animancer Free** - animation management with UniTask-based completion handling
- **DoTween** - smooth animations for objects and UI
- **Zenject** - dependency injection, factories, and signals
